### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brandon Eads

I am an American that recently moved to Melbourne, Australia.

My passion is to travel worldwide, meet people, learn about their culture, and taste their food. It does help me appreciate life in general and not to take anything for granted.

My other passion is to be an excellent developer and learn as many languages as possible. The most recent leadership role was lead system administrator, and I find it very challenging and yet rewarding at the same time.

I am currently working on my website featuring my love for travel, adventure and foodie blog.
